# analyseMRI
analyseMRI is free and easy to use MRI T1-weighted and FLAIR scan analysis software for analyzing the Hippocampus, Amygdala and Cerebral Cortex for their volume (in cubic millimeter, based on T1-weighted scan) and voxel intensity (based on FLAIR scan) parameters. The software yields both absolute values and relative (to the Cerebral White Matter) values for these parameters.

This software uses both a T1-weighted and a FLAIR scan as input, providing results of the comparison of the analyzed scan to an established healthy control baseline, as well as quick-view volumetric results and a one-sided hyperintensity check for the hippocampus and amygdala.

The main intended usage for this software is to aid neurological health professionals in objectively diagnosing and researching Hippocampus, Amygdala and Cerebral Cortex related deficits and illnesses.

This software can now be used for any isotropic voxel resolution T1-weighted scans.
Before installing (analyseMRI_installer.exe) please read the user manual, this will clarify the required preprocessing for the usable input data type (.nii).
